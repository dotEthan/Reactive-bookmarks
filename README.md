Just getting started.

## Overview and Thoughts

### What's Working

Building the base structure using techniques learned in [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's React Tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/). Highly recommended and kept up-to-date!

Will likley use firebase as a backend to start with.

Right now just getting all the functionality I need installed. 

### What isn't working

So far it's working exactly as it should, though it's early days so that basically means nothing's really working yet.
